  "response": "I see only one image actually being shared - a neon blue computer or monitor icon with a glowing effect against a dark background. It appears to be a minimalist, modern icon design showing a screen with some text-like elements and a keyboard below it. The design uses a neon light aesthetic with bright blue-white lines creating the outline. The image has a reflective effect at the bottom adding depth.\n\nI don't see a second image to compare it with. If you'd like me to compare two images, please share both images and I'll be happy to analyze their visual styles, complexity, and purposes."
