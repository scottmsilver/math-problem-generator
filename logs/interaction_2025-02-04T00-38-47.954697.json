  "response": "This image shows a neon-style icon or logo of a computer monitor or terminal display. It's rendered in glowing blue-white lines against a dark background, creating a retro or cyberpunk aesthetic. The icon includes a screen with what appears to be text or command lines represented by horizontal bars, and below it is a keyboard indicated by a row of small dashes. The entire design is simplified and minimalist, with rounded corners and a slight reflection effect at the bottom. The glowing effect gives it a futuristic, technological feel."
